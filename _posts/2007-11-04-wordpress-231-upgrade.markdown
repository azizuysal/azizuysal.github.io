I upgraded my [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/download/) to 2.3.1 today. I followed the instructions on [this page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress) and everything went smoothly. No problems whatsoever.I also started using [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) 2.0.3 to write my blog posts. This is the first one I'm writing using MarsEdit. It seems like a nice Cocoa application, though I'm not sure what its benefits are compared to WordPress's own browser-based writing tool. I guess I'll have to continue using both to figure that out. (I just noticed that MarsEdit has a find-as-you-type spell checker. Nice.)
